Notes:
1^In linked list only sequencial access is possible we can not random access
2^Accessing of any elelment neeed O(n) time complexity.In array it is O(1)
3^Insertion and deletion is easy
4^Linked list is linear data structure that are stored at non consecutive memory locations
5^Some extra space is required to store the pointers
6^Binary search is not possible(we can not go directly to middle element)
7^It is of dynamic size
